Version 2.2.3 (08.22.2016)
-------------
* Fixed an issue where federated endpoints redirecting to URLs that would trigger URL canonicalization would cause OIDC to go to that endpoint twice. This was causing some non-OIDCFS federated endpoints to fail.
* (Mac Only) Fixed thread safety issues in -[OIDCTokenCache serialize] (#710)
* Allow redirect URIs that start with "http://". however we still will not traverse those pages but we will get the authorization code from the URL. (#720)
* Separate out the library build targets so applications including OIDC's project file as a subproject can pull in either the Framework cleanly. However using both the framework and static library can still cause issues. This is an unavoidable side effect of the header search order in Xcode. (#693)

* Error codes will appear as strings (ie. "OIDC_ERROR_SERVER_USER_INPUT_REQUIRED") in error messages now.
* Limited support for App Extensions. OIDC now has an app extension safe build in both the Xcode project (iOS static lib only) and CocoaPod. Interactive Auth is not supported in extensions as well. (#560)
* Fixed a bug that caused OIDC to erroneously unpercent encode query parameters being passed on. (#689)


Version 2.2.0 (05.16.2016)
-------------
* Added support for Family of Client IDs among Microsoft apps
* (iOS Only) Added +[OIDCKeychainTokenCache defaultKeychainCache] and +[OIDCKeychainTokenCache keychainCacheForGroup:] APIs to make how to use the keychain token cache APIs more discoverable.
